## Driving Experience and Insurance Claims

### The visualization below shows insight into the relationship between driving experience and filing an insurance claim ('OUTCOME'). By looking at the first range of driving experience (0-9), it's apparent that the highest number of drivers (about 2,200) filing claims this year had less than 10 years of driving experience.

## Marriage and Insurance Claims

### The visualization below shows insight into the relationship between a driver's marriage (0 = not married, 1 = married) status and filing an insurance claim (0 = not filed, 1 = filed). We can see here that the number of claims filed by unmarried drivers (about 2,000) is about twice as many as those filed by married drivers.
